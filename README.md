## Introduction
The project consists of the creation of a counter that allows the user to increase and decrease its value, which will initially be 0, by 1 using the two +/- buttons.
In addition to the basic functions, I have created a reset button, which allows the counter value to be reset to zero, and the converter function which converts the number of steps into metres and kilometers.

## Structure
The structure of the project:

index.html : contains the backbone structure of the project, in which the style sheet (CSS) for the graphics of the step counter and the script for the functions are inserted.
styles.css: the style sheet with which I created the style and graphics of the step counter.
script.js: script used to create the various HTML elements and the counter functions (increase/decrease, reset and the conversion of steps to metres).

## Technologies Used
I used several technologies to create the StepSync counter:
Visual Studio Code, as the editor for writing the code.
Canva, with an editor for the images, videos and icons used.
HTML, to create the counter structure.Bootstrap, the CSS framework for developing the web interface that I used to make the site 100% responsive.
CSS, for the style sheets;
JavaScript, the programming language I use for the counter functionality.
Git, by far the most widely used modern version control system globally today.
Firebase, the free hosting to host the project and make it visible.

## Usability
Using the counter is very simple. The counter value is increased and decreased by 1 with a click on the + / - buttons. To reset the current value, simply click on the reset button.
Each step is converted to meter units, so one step is equivalent to 0.6 meters.
In addition, when the calculated meters reach 1000 automatically these are converted to kilometers and the unit of measurement changes from meters to kilometers.

## Responsive
Thanks to the use of Media Queries, I was able to take care of the Responsive aspect of the counter and the site, which adapts perfectly to the changing size of the device on which it is displayed.
